# Constellation Observer 2.0

This project is a tribute to my Dad's invention, a chair to help observe the stars. It's a web-based VR experience that simulates watching the night sky.

## How to run

1. You need a web server to run this project. If you have python installed you can run `python3 -m http.server` in the project directory.
2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.
3. If you are on a mobile phone, you can use a VR holder to get a more immersive experience.

## The Experience

The web app displays a starfield with the following constellations:

*   Orion
*   The Big Dipper (Ursa Major)

You can look around by moving your device.

## The Story

My Dad in the early 90s invented a "chair" to help observe the stars. It was car seat on top of a metalic structure with some rotors and a stand for binoculars, so the user can just be seated with holding a remote to control the chair and watch the starts. He used to show this in public schools as a science project but you can't observe stars at day time so he added some early type of googles that connect to laptop/pc and used a constelation program so you could simulate watching the night sky indoors.
